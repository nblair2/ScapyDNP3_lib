#DNP3 Dissector for Scapy

The Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3) is defined in [IEEE Std 1815](https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/1815-2012.html) for the purpose of distributing event data for operation on a variety of communication media consistent with the makeup of most electric power communication systems.

This project is work-in-progress by the Queensland University of Technology(QUT) [Information Security discipline](https://www.qut.edu.au/science-engineering/our-schools/school-of-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/information-security) and was developed to study cyber attacks on DNP3 critical infrustrcutre. The work can be demonstrated in our paper, [Real-Time and Interactive Attacks on DNP3 Critical Infrastructure Using Scapy](http://crpit.com/confpapers/CRPITV161Rodofile.pdf), published in the CRPIT and Presented at the Australasian Information Security Conference (AISC 2015) in Sydney Australia.  

This code is also used in the following papers:

Rodofile, Nicholas R., Kenneth Radke, and Ernest Foo. "[DNP3 network scanning and reconnaissance for critical infrastructure.](http://eprints.qut.edu.au/93117/)" Proceedings of the Australasian Computer Science Week Multiconference. ACM, 2016.

If you use this code in any academic work, it would be very much appreciated if you cite our papers.

Please note that this code requires the [scapy](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/doc/index.html) library.
